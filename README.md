### Project Name: CreativeSpace - Where Your Words Find Their Voice!

CreativeSpace is an interactive web platform designed to provide a space for users to express their creativity by sharing written content. The platform allows users to create, view, and manage blog-like posts, offering an intuitive, user-friendly interface to unleash their storytelling potential.

### Key Features:

1. **Navigation & Branding**:

   - The navigation bar includes a logo, links to key sections like the homepage, and a prominent "Write" button that allows users to start writing new posts immediately. There's also a theme toggle button to switch between light and dark modes, enhancing the user experience.

2. **Post Creation & Editing**:

    - Users can create new posts through a dynamic editor interface that allows for adding a title, cover image URL, and content. The editor is designed to be simple yet powerful, with a rich-text area for content and straightforward input fields for easy customization.

3. **Interactive Interface**:
   
    - The homepage features a large hero section with a welcoming message to inspire users to start creating. The posts are displayed in a grid layout, giving visitors access to various user-generated content, further motivating them to engage with the platform.

4. **Rich User Experience**:
   
    - The user interface is clean and minimalistic, focusing on content creation with seamless navigation. The integration of icons from the Lucide library adds a modern touch to buttons and navigation links.

5. **Customizable Themes**:
   
    - Users can toggle between light and dark modes with a simple click, making the platform more adaptable to different user preferences and environments.
